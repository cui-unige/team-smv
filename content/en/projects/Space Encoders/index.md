In this project, two of our students collaborated on the elaboration of a cooperative "serious game" to teach programming concepts to beginners.

You can find Marvin Fouratie's bachelor thesis [here](/team-smv/projects/Marvin_BSc_rapport.pdf), and Patrick Sardinha's thesis [here](/team-smv/projects/Patrick_Sardinha_Projet_Bachelor.pdf). Note that both documents are written in French.
