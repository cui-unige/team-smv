The development of complex and reliable software systems requires rigorous methods for modelling, designing and verifying them.  
The *Semantics, Modelling and Verification* (SMV) group is a research laboratory involved in the design of formalisms dedicated to the analysis of properties of systems, as well as the automatic generation of their code and of pertinent test cases.  
A coherent set of tools has been developed by the group to apply the methods to software-intensive systems.

The SMV lab is part of the [Centre Universitaire d'Informatique](http://www.cui.unige.ch/fr/) and the [Computer Science Department](https://www.unige.ch/dinfo/) of the [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/).
