We currently have several propositions for students who would be interested in doing bachelor or master projects with us:

#### Bachelor Projects

* Visualisation of High-Level Petri Nets. 
* Implementation of a lazy functional programming language.
* Development of a game to teach the basic principles of logic. 

#### Master Projects

* Development of a *forward* model checker for CTL formulae.
* Application of model checking to verify the correctness of security protocols.
* Development of a tool for the visualisation of error traces in Rust programs.

Students are of course also welcome to come and see us with their own ideas for projects.
