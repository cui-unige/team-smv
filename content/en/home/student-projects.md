We currently have several propositions for students who would be interested in doing bachelor or master projects with us:

#### Bachelor Projects

* Development of a tool to define the semantic rules of programming languages and to derive them mechanically.
* Design and implementation of a static analysis tool to check that the variables in a program respect the [*definite assigment*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/variables) property.
* Design and implementation of an approach for the modelling of [*substructural type systems*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substructural_type_system) with Petri nets. Examples of languages that use such type systems are [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/fr) and [Pony](https://www.ponylang.io/).

#### Master Projects

* Development of a tool for the visualization of *Hero Nets*. Hero Nets are a special kind of high-level Petri Nets which can manipulate higher order functions as tokens.
* Design and implementation of a tool to detect *memory leaks* in [Swift](https://swift.org/) programs. Good C/C++ skills are preferable for this project, as it will require to hack the Swift runtime.
* Design and implementation of an approach to analyse and report the complexity of type checking on a program's expressions.

Students are of course also welcome to come and see us with their own ideas for projects.
