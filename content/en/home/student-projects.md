We currently have several propositions for students who would be interested in doing bachelor or master projects with us:

#### Bachelor Projects

* Development of a tool for the definition of semantic rules for programming languages and their mechanized derivation 
* ...

#### Master Projects

* Development of a tool for the visualization of *Hero Nets*. Hero Nets are a special kind of high-level Petri Nets which can manipulate higher order functions as tokens.

Students are of course also welcome to come and see us with their own ideas for projects.
