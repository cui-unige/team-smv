Developing complex and reliable software systems requires rigorous methods
for modelling, designing and verifying them.
The SMV group is involved in designing dedicated formalisms that are
semantically well described in order to make analysis of system properties
possible, to automatically produce code and to select pertinent test cases.
A coherent set of tools has been developed in order to apply our methods
to software-intensive systems.
