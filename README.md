Developing complex and reliable software systems requires rigorous methods
for modelling, designing and verifying them.
The SMV group is involved in designing dedicated formalisms that are
semantically well described in order to make analysis of system properties
possible, to automatically produce code and to select pertinent test cases.
A coherent set of tools has been developed in order to apply our methods
to software-intensive systems.

## Bachelor projects

The SMV group is currently creating an automated plant growing system
connected to the Internet of Things (IoT).
The system consists of single-board computers (Raspberry Pi),
various sensors (light, distance, temperature, humidity)
and actuators (water pumps).
Currently various different software libraries are necessary to interact
with these peripheral devices locally,
while remote access to the sensor readings is not possible.

* [IoT data visualisation]({{ site.url }}/team-smv/assets/bachelor-projects-1.pdf)

  The goal of this project is to connect the systems to the IoT.
  This will be performed by introducing a homogeneous API locally on the Raspberry Pi.
  This API should be accessible programmatically from other systems (e.g. through a REST interface).
  Further, a web user interface should be created to stream data to the internet and provide remote monitoring capabilities to any users.
  For this part an evaluation of existing IoT platforms (dweet.io, freeboard.io, io.adafruit.com, etc.) should be performed
  and evaluated against an own, application-specific development using HTML, CSS3 & JavaScript libraries.
  The final outcome will be a monitoring and control software that is versatile and can be accessed platform independently.

* [IoT Scheduling and Planning]({{ site.url }}/team-smv/assets/bachelor-projects-2.pdf)

  The goal of this project is to create a scheduling and planning API for the IoT system.
  This will be implemented by introducing an API locally on the Raspberry Pi that allows users to define a schedule for sensor readings and actuator actions.
  The controller should then follow the plan and perform the actions as specified.
  The definition of the plan should be possible both programmatically via a REST API (e.g. using JSON/XML/...) or with a web user interface.
  This user interface should provide an appealing and easily comprehensible means to view and edit the current execution plan.
  This can be implemented by using one of the many already existing JavaScript libraries.
  The final outcome will be a monitoring and scheduling controller that is versatile and can be accessed platform independently.

The SMV group is currently developing CREST, a graphical modeling language for the design of home automation, automatic plant growing and similar systems.
While the first version of the language is being implemented in Python, a graphical editor is necessary for user friendly interaction.

* [Web based modeling editor]({{ site.url }}/team-smv/assets/bachelor-projects-3.pdf)

  The goal is to create a versatile and extensible prototype web editor for the representation of CREST diagrams.
  The development should be based on existing plotting and layout libraries (D3.js, Cytoscape.js, ELK.js).
  The features to develop include creation, modification and layouting of component-and-connector views, collapsing/uncollapsing of nested nodes and redrawing of information.
  Depending on the student’s interests, it is possible to pursue three different specialisations of this project:

  * layouting and visualisation of CREST diagrams: research into the optimal position of diagram elements to facilitate reading and information flow
  * GUI design: evaluate different interaction opportunities within browser based graphical editors and facilitate object manipulation
  * backend communication: communication, synchronization and consistency between the web front-end with the Python-based backend
